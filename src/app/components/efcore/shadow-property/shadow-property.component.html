  <h1 style="font-size: 3rem;">Shadow Property in Entity Framework Core</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Entity Framework Core introduced a new type of property called "Shadow" property which was not exist in EF 6.x.
  </p>
  <p>Shadow properties are properties that are not defined in your .NET entity class directly; instead, you configure it
    for the particular entity type in the entity data model. They can be configured in the OnModelCreating() method of
    the context class.</p>
  <p>As you can see in the above figure, shadow properties are not part of your emtity class. So, you cannot access it
    as you access other properties of an entity. Shadow properties can only be configured for an entity type while
    building an Entity Data Model and they are also mapped to a database column. The value and state of the shadow
    properties are maintained purely in the Change Tracker</p>

  <p>Let's understand the pratical aspect of the shadow property. Assume that we need to maintain the creaated and
    updated date of each record in the database table. You learned how to set created and modified date of entities in
    EF Core by defining CreateDate and UpdateDate properties in entity classes. Here, we will see how to achieve the
    same result by using shadow properties without including them in entity classes.</p>

  <p>Consider the following Student entity class.</p>
  <pre>
    {{text1}}
  </pre>
  <p>The above Student does not include CreatedDate and UpdatedDate properties to maintain created or updated time.
    We will configure them as shadow properties on the Student entity.
  </p>
  <br>

  <!-- Defining Shadow Property -->
  <span style="font-size: 2rem;" class="pb-0">Defining Shadow Property</span>
  <div class="border-b1"></div>
  <p>You can define the shadow properties for an entity type using the Fluent API in the OnModelCreating() using the
    Property() method</p>
  <p>The following configure two shadow properties CreatedDate and UpdatedDate on the Student entity</p>
  <pre>
          {{text2}}
        </pre>
  <p>As you can see, the Property() method is used to configure a shadow property. Specify the name of the shadow
    property as a string and the type as a generic parameter. If the name specified in the Property() method matches the
    name of an existing property, then the EF Core will configure that existing property as a shadow property rather
    than introducting a new shadow property.</p>
  <br>

  <!-- Shadow Properties in the Database -->
  <span style="font-size: 2rem;" class="pb-0">Shadow Properties in the Database
  </span>
  <div class="border-b1"></div>
  <p>Once we define shadow properties, we need to update the database schema because shadow properties will be mapped to
    the corresponding database column.</p>
  <p>To do this, add database migration using the following command in Package Manager Console in Visual Studio</p>
  <p>Now, the Student table will include two columns, CreatedDate and UpdatedDate in SQL Server, as shown below.</p>
  <p>Thus, the database will have corresponding columns even if we haven't included these properties in the Student
    class and configured them as shadow properties</p>

  <!-- Access Shadow Property -->
  <span style="font-size: 2rem;" class="pb-0">Access Shadow Property
  </span>
  <div class="border-b1"></div>
  <p>You can get or set the values of the shadow properties using the Property() method of EntityEntry. The following
    code access the value of the shadow property.</p>
  <pre>
          {{text3}}
        </pre>
  <p>However, in our scenario, we want to set the value to these shadow properties automatically on the SaveChange()
    method, so that we don't have to set them manully on each entity object. So, override the SaveChanges() method in
    the context class, as shown below</p>
  <pre>
          {{text4}}
        </pre>
  <p>This will automatically set values to Created and UpdatedDate shadow propertities.</p>
  <p>Now, execute the following code and check the record in the database.</p>
  <pre>
        {{text5}}
      </pre>
  <p>The aboce code will insert the following record with CreatedDate and UpdatedDate in the Students table.</p>
  <p>Thus, by configuring shadow properties, we don't have to include them in entity class</p>

  <!-- Configuring Shadow Properties on All Entities -->
  <span style="font-size: 2rem;" class="pb-0">Configuring Shadow Properties on All Entities
  </span>
  <div class="border-b1"></div>
  <p>You can configure shadow propertities on all entities at once, rather than configuring them manually for all.</p>
  <p>For example, we can configure CreatedData and UpdatedDate on all the entities at once, as shown below</p>
  <pre>
          {{text6}}
        </pre>

  <!-- When to use shadow properties? -->
  <span style="font-size: 2rem;" class="pb-0">When to use shadow properties?
  </span>
  <div class="border-b1"></div>
  <p>Shadow propertities can be used in two scenarios:</p>
  <p>1. When you don't want to expose database columns on the mapped entities, such as the scenario discussed above</p>
  <p>2. When you don't want to expose foreign key property and want to manage relationship only using navigation
    propertities. The foreign key property will be shadow property and mapped to the database column but will not be
    exposed as a property od an entity. (In EF Core, if you don't define foreign key property in entity classes then it
    will automatically generate shadow property for that. You don't need to configure foreign key property manully)</p>
