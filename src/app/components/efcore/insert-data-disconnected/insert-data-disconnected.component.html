  <p>You learned abot h∆° to save data in the connected scenario. Here, you will learn about saving data in the
    disconnected scenario.
  </p>
  <p>Saving data in the disconnected scenario is a little bit different than in the connected scenario, In the
    disconnected scenario, the DbContext is not aware of disconnected entities because entities were added or modified
    out of the scope of the current DbContext instance. So, you need to attach the disconnected entities to a context
    with appropriate EntityState in order to perform CUD operations to the database.</p>
  <p>The following firure illustrates the CUD operarions in disconnected scenario</p>
  <p>As per the above figure, disconnected entities(entities which are not being tracked by the DbContext) need to be
    attached to the DbContext with an appropriate EntityState. For example, Added state for new entitie, Modified state
    for the editef entities and Deleted state for the deleted entities, which will result in an INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE
    command in the database when the SaveChanges() method is called.</p>
  <p>The following steps must be performed in order to insert, update or delete records into the DB table using Entity
    Framework Core in disconnected scenario:</p>
  <p>1. Attach an entity to DbContext with an approprite entityState e.g Added, Modified, or Deleted</p>
  <p>2. Call SaveChanges() method</p>
  <p>The following example demonstrates inserting a new record into the database using the above steps:</p>
  <pre>
        {{text1}}
      </pre>
  <p>In the above example, std is a disconnected instance of the Student entity. The context.Add Student>() method
    attaches a Student entity to a context with an Added state. The SaveChanges() method builds and executes the
    following INSERT statement</p>
  <pre>
        {{text2}}
      </pre>
  <p>EF Core provides multiple ways to add entities with Added state. In the above example, context.Students.Add(std);,
    context.Entry Student>(std).State = EntityState.Added; and context.Attach Student>(std); will result in same INSERT
    statement as above.</p>
  <p>Entity Framework Core provides the following DbContext and DbSet methods which attach disconnected entities with
    Added EntityState, which in turn will execute INSERT statements in the database</p>

  <strong>Note:</strong>
  <p>The above DbContext methods are introduced in EF Core (they were not available in EF 6 or prior). Both DbContext
    and DbSet methods perform the same operation. Which one you use depends on your coding pattern and preference.</p>

  <!-- Insert Multiple Records -->

  <p>Use the DbContext.AddRange or DbSet.AddRange method to add multiple entities in one go. You don't need to call
    DbContext.Add method multiple times.</p>

  <p>In the example above, context.Add Student>(std) adds an instance of Student entity. EF Core API reaches the
    StudentAddress instance through the reference navigation property of Student and marks EntityState of both the
    entities to Added, which will build and execute the following two INSERT commands on SaveChanges().</p>

  <p>The following example demonstrates adding a list of Student entity objects using AddRange.</p>
  <pre>
      {{text5}}
    </pre>
  <p>The above example will insert two new records in the Students table.</p>
  <p>You can also add a list of different types of entities, as shown below.</p>
  <pre>
        {{text6}}
      </pre>
  <p>In the above example, entityList is a type of List Object>. So, it can contain any type of entities. The AddRange()
    method adds all the specified entities to a context and SaveChanges() will build and execute INSERT statements for
    all in one go.</p>
  <p>EF Core improves the performance by executing INSERT statements for all the above entities in a single database
    round trip. The above example will execute the following statements in the database.</p>
  <pre>
      {{text7}}

  <!-- Insert Data Using DbSet -->
  <span style="font-size: 2rem;" class="pb-0">Insert Data Using DbSet
  </span>
  <div class="border-b1"></div>
  <p>As mentioned before, you can use DbSet to save an instance of an entity which will be translated into
    INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE command in the database, in the same way as EF 6.x.</p>
  <p>Use the DbSet TEntity>.Add() method to attach an entity with Added state or the DbSet TEntity>.AddRange() method to
    attach a collection of entities with Added state, as shown below.</p>
  <pre>
        {{text8}}
      </pre>
  <p>In the above example, the type of context.Students is DbSet Student> type. So, we can add the Student entity only.
    The context.Students.Add(std) attaches the Student entity to the context with the Added state, which will result
    in the INSERT statement when the SaveChanges() method is called.</p>
