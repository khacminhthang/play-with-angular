  <h1 style="font-size: 3rem;">Configure One-to-Many Relationships using Fluent API in Entity Framework Core</h1>
  <br>
  <p>You learn about the Conventions for the One-to-Many Relationship. Generally, you don't need to configure
    one-to-many relationships because EF Core includes enough conventions which will automatically configure them.
    However, you can use Fluent API to configure the one-to-many relationships if you decide to have all the EF
    configurations in Fluent API for easy maintenance.
  </p>
  <p>Entity Framework Core made it easy to configure relationships using Fluent API. Consider the following Student and
    Grade classes where the Grade entity includes many Student entities</p>
  <pre>
        {{text1}}
      </pre>
  <p>Configure the one-to-many relationships for the above entities using Fluent API by overriding the OnModelCrating
    method in the context class, as shown below</p>
  <pre>
        {{text2}}
      </pre>
  <p>In the example above, the following code snippet configures the one-to-many relationships</p>
  <pre>
      {{text3}}
    </pre>
  <p>Now, to reflect this in the database, execute migration commands, add-migration "name" and update-database. The
    database will include two tables with One-to-Many relationships as shown below</p>
  <p>Let's understand the above code step by step</p>
  <p>First, we need to start configuring with one entity class, either Student or Grade. So, modelBuilder.Entity
    Student>() start with the Student entity</p>
  <p>Then, .HasOne Grade>(s=>s.Grade) specifies that the Student entity includes a Grade type property named Grade.</p>
  <p>Now, we need to configure the other end the relationship, the Grade entity. The .WithMany(g => g.Students)
    specifies that the Grade entity class includes many Student entities. Here, WithMany infers collection navigation
    property.</p>
  <p>The .HasForeignKey int>(s=> s.CurrentGradeId) specifies the name of the foreign key property CurrentGradeId. This
    is optional. Use it only when you have the foreign key Id property in the dependent class</p>
  <p>Alternatively, you can start configuring the relationship with the Grade entity instead of the Student entity, as
    shown below</p>
  <pre>
        {{text4}}
      </pre>

  <!-- Configure Cascade Delete using Fluent API -->
  <span style="font-size: 2rem;" class="pb-0">Configure Cascade Delete using Fluent API
  </span>
  <div class="border-b1"></div>
  <p>Cascade delete automatically deletes the child row when the related parent row is deleted. For example, if a Grade
    is deleted, then all the Students in that grade should also be deleted from the database automatically</p>
  <p>Use the OnDelete method to donfigure the cascade delete between Student and Grade entities, as shown below</p>
  <pre>
      {{text4}}
    </pre>
  <p>The OnDelete() method cascade delete behaviour uses the DeleteBehavior parameter. you can specify any of the
    following DeleteBehavior values, based on your requirement</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cascade: Dependent entities will be deleted when the principal entity is deleted</li>
    <li>ClientSetNull: The values of foreign key properties in the dependent entities will be set null</li>
    <li>Restrict: Prevents Cascade delete</li>
    <li>SetNull: The values of foreign key propertis in the dependent entities will be set to null</li>
  </ul>
